## How do conflicts propagate through media depending on their geolocation

# Abstract

As an individual it is really hard to grasp a broad view of our world. Each media usually focuses on news influenced by its geolocation, political orientation, public of interest or many other variables. Hence, they all provide a biased representation of the world. By merging them altogether, we are able to get a more accurate and authentic view. Using GDELT Project, such diversity of media sources is available and aggregated all around the world. Those datasets enable us to quantify and geolocally visualize the propagation of news related to any specific event.

# Research questions

How is the distribution of any events in the different region of the world ? Are there inequalities between those region regarded to any event type or to their coverage by the media ?

# Dataset

GDELT dataset 

List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.
