## How do conflicts propagate through media depending on their geolocation

# Abstract

As an individual it is really hard to grasp a broad view of our world. Each media usually focuses on news influenced by its geolocation, political orientation, public of interest or many other variables. Hence, they all provide a biased representation of the world. By merging them altogether, we are able to get a more accurate and authentic view. Using GDELT Project, such diversity of media sources is available and aggregated for conflicts all around the world. Those datasets enable us to quantify and geolocally visualize the propagation of the news related to any conflict.
