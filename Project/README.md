## How do conflicts propagate through media depending on their geolocation

# Abstract

As an individual it is really hard to grasp a broad view of our world. Each media usually focuses on news influenced by its geolocation, political orientation, public of interest or many other variables. Hence, they all provide a biased representation of the world. By merging them altogether, we are able to get a more accurate and authentic view. Using GDELT Project, such diversity of media sources is available, it is focused on conflits and it aggregates data from all around the world. Those datasets enable us to quantify and visualize the distribution of conflictual events by regions or patterns.

# Research questions

- How is the distribution of any events in the different regions of the world ?
- Are there inequalities between those regions regarded to any event type or to their coverage by the media ?
- Can we distinguish patterns while aggregating the data ? Does it evolve thoughout time ?

# Dataset

GDELT dataset 

<s>List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.</s>

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2

1. Aggregate some sample data
2. Visualize it on a world map
3. Filter events by their types 
4. Detect patterns

# Questions for TAs

Is it possible to slightly modify our research questions ?
Can we update our planning for the next milestone depending on the difficulties encountered ?

<s>Add here some questions you have for us, in general or project-specific.</s>
